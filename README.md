  This firmware is based on the work of Ricardo - CA2RXU (many TNX's) which I modified for my Heltec wireless Device, according to my needs and vision.
For now it is only available for this model, which I own and have had the opportunity to test, possibly in the future other models will be added.
  I needed to have a button to send beacons outside of the scheduled time, in case we are in a difficult propagation area and to study connectivity, 
so that we don't have to wait another 15 or 30 minutes until the next TX.
  I also wanted to keep the connectivity with the tracker, so that after saving the data (indicator, travel mode) it does not "disappear" but connects to the router 
 (you have to add its SSID and password in the settings page) or to the phone's hotspot, when you are in portable mode.
  Then I wanted it to be a button for the unpleasant case of emergencies, SOS, for those of us who travel on mountains and difficult routes, 
most of them without GSM signal coverage and, even if it is not needed, it is very useful in case of accidents or unwanted and unforeseen events, a solution to get help in desperate cases.
  For now, this is only possible through the UI on the web page, in the future I want to add a physical button for this,
but one that cannot be pressed accidentally but only in case of need, I'm still thinking about it.
                                  
                                  ONLY TO BE USED IN THESE CASES!!!

                                  
     Below are some photos to help you with scheduling and to give you an idea of ​​what it looks like.
